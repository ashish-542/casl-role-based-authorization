Create a nest.js project
Install casl project -> npm i @casl/ability
Add requirements

Add new resourec user-> nest g resource user

Add User Schema -> fields will be id and isAdmin

Create ability module  - whole authorization(CASL) code will be inside it as nestjs is good with encapsulation

> nest g module ability

Create ability.factory file - we will define all the permissions here.

> nest g class ability/ability.factory

Make AbilityFactory as provider by adding @Injectable

> @Injectable()

Add defineAbility function inside the AbilityFactory class

Define the actions and subject enum -> manage,create, read, update and delete

To use TypeScript, we have to be use interfaces
-> subject interface
-> ability interface

//For type checking

>export type AppAbility = MongoAbility<[Action, Subjects]>

>const builder = new AbilityBuilder<AppAbility>(createMongoAbility);
